<p>Antlr is a public-domain software tool developed by Terence Parr to assist in developing translators and compilers. It specifically allows a user to provide a lexical and syntactic description using extended BNF grammar notation and then generates a top-down, recursive-descent parser to recognize the language. The allowable set of grammars is LL(*), which means a parser generator can theoretically look ahead an infinite number of tokens to determine which production to select next. Antlr is not as powerful as the Yacc/Lex family of tools, which support LALR grammar. Still, it is powerful enough to express most languages of interest. It also provides many features/hacks that allow you to express some language features that ordinarily would require either an LALR grammar or a context-sensitive grammar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. ANTLR appears to be popular in the open-source community. It is utilized by Apache Camel, Apache Lucene, Apache Hadoop,<br>
Groovy, and Hibernate, among others. They were all in need of a parser for a custom language. Hibernate, for example, employs ANTLR to parse its query language HQL.</p>

<h2 id="llk-grammars">LL(K) Grammars</h2>
<p>An LL parser is a top-down parser for a subset of context-free languages.  It parses the input from Left to right, performing the Leftmost derivation of the sentence.  An LL parser is called an LL(k) parser if it uses k tokens of look-ahead when parsing a sentence. The LL(K) parser is a deterministic pushdown automaton that can peek at the following k input symbols without reading.</p>
<ul>
<li>An LL parser is called an LL(*) parser (an LL-regular parser) if<br>
not restricted to finite k tokens of look-ahead. Still, it can make<br>
parsing decisions by recognizing whether the following tokens belong<br>
to a common language.</li>
<li>LL (LL(1), LL(k), LL(*)) recursive-descent parsers can parse<br>
grammars.</li>
<li>ANTLR is a recursive descent parser Generator!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="runtime-libraries-and-code-generation-targets">Runtime Libraries and Code Generation Targets</h2>
<p>The Antlr tool is written in Java; however, it can generate parsers and lexers in various languages. To run the parser and lexer, you will also need to have the runtime library of ANTLR alongside the parser and lexer code. The supported target language (and runtime libraries) are the<br>
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Python (2 and 3)</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>ANTLR takes as input a grammar that specifies a language and generates<br>
as output source code for a recognizer for that languageâ€”supported<br>
generating code in Java, C#, JavaScript, Python2, and Python3.</p>

<h2 id="who-uses-antlr">Who uses ANTLR?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Twitter search uses ANTLR for querying and parsing</li>
<li>Hive and Pig use ANTLR</li>
<li>Oracle uses ANTLR in their SQL developer IDE</li>
<li>Netbeans IDE</li>
<li>And many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, ANTLR will generate a parser from the command line in the Java programming language:</p>
<pre class=" language-bash"><code class="prism  language-bash">    Java -jar antlr-4.5.3-complete.jar HelloWorld.g4 //Will output a java parser 

</code></pre>
<p>To change the target language, you can run the following command from<br>
the command line:</p>
<pre class=" language-cmd"><code class="prism  language-cmd">    antlr4 -Dlanguage=CSharpHelloWorld.g4 

</code></pre>
<p>You can select the target from within your .g4 grammar file by including the target within the global section:</p>
<pre class=" language-csharp"><code class="prism  language-csharp">   
    options <span class="token punctuation">{</span> language <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"CSharp"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span>  

</code></pre>
<h2 id="antlr-internals">ANTLR Internals</h2>
<p>ANTLR generates a parser from a formal language called Grammar. See thefollowing Grammar.</p>
<pre class=" language-csharp"><code class="prism  language-csharp">    grammar HelloWorld<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    options <span class="token punctuation">{</span> language <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"CSharp"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span>  
    greet   <span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'hello'</span> ID<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    ID  <span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>a<span class="token operator">-</span>z<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    WS  <span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span> \t\r\n<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> skip <span class="token punctuation">;</span>

</code></pre>

<p>Then ANTLR builds the parse tree, which are the data structures that represent how Grammar matches the input.</p>

<p>Antlr also generates a tree walker that you can use to generate<br>
application-specific code. You can invoke those generated parsers<br>
specifying the text you want to parse. You will get a representation in<br>
memory of the structures recognized. This representation is called<br>
<em>Abstract Syntax Tree</em> (AST).</p>
<h2 id="what-can-you-do-with-ast-abstract-syntax-tree">What can you do with AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)?</h2>
<p>Once you have an AST, it opens up various possibilities for working with the parsed code. Here are some common use cases for AST:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Validation</strong>: The AST allows you to perform static analysis and validate the code against predefined rules or constraints. You can traverse the tree and check for potential errors, type inconsistencies, or other code quality issues. By analyzing the structure and semantics of the code, you can ensure its correctness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: You can interpret the AST to execute the code directly. This is commonly seen in scripting languages or dynamic environments where the AST is evaluated at runtime. The interpreter traverses the tree, performs the specified operations, and produces the desired output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compilation</strong>: ASTs are often used as an intermediate representation during the compilation process. The AST can be transformed into lower-level representations, such as bytecode or machine code, to generate an executable program. The compilation process involves traversing the AST, analyzing the code, optimizing it, and generating efficient executable code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code Generation</strong>: ASTs provide a structured representation of the code, which makes it easier to generate alternative representations or translations. For example, you can transform the AST into another programming language or generate documentation, diagrams, or visualizations based on the code structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transformation</strong>: ASTs can be modified or transformed to apply code refactorings, optimizations, or other modifications. By traversing the AST and making changes to the nodes, you can refactor the code, improve its performance, or adapt it to specific requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: The AST can be analyzed to extract information or calculate various metrics about the code. For example, you can analyze the AST to determine code complexity, identify patterns, detect code smells, or extract code metrics like cyclomatic complexity, code coverage, or dependency analysis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The lexer plays a crucial role in the parsing process, as it determines how the input text is tokenized. The lexer follows certain rules to match the input against predefined patterns or tokens. The rules include considering the longest matching rule first, prioritizing literal tokens before regular lexer rules, following document order, and ensuring that fragment rules do not match their own patterns.</p>
<p>By leveraging the AST and the capabilities provided by lexer and parser rules, you can perform a wide range of tasks related to code analysis, transformation, interpretation, and compilation. ASTs provide a structured representation of code, enabling powerful static analysis and manipulation of code structures.</p>
